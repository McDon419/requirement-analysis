## Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?
A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of how users (actors) interact with a system to achieve specific goals. It captures functional requirements by illustrating the relationships between actors and use cases.

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**
- Provides a **clear overview** of system functionality.  
- Helps identify **interactions between users and the system**.  
- Facilitates communication between stakeholders and developers.  
- Acts as a **foundation for creating detailed requirements and test cases**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### What is Acceptance Criteria?
Acceptance Criteria (AC) are **predefined conditions that a software product or feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholders or end users**. They serve as a checklist that determines whether the implementation of a requirement is complete and working as intended.  

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis
- **Clarity and Alignment**: Ensures that stakeholders, developers, and testers share the same understanding of what “done” means for a requirement.  
- **Guides Development**: Helps developers know exactly what functionality is expected before coding begins.  
- **Facilitates Testing**: Provides testers with specific, measurable conditions to validate during quality assurance.  
- **Reduces Ambiguity**: Minimizes misunderstandings by converting vague requirements into concrete, testable statements.  
- **Improves Stakeholder Confidence**: Demonstrates that requirements are being met as expected, increasing satisfaction.

### Example: Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature

For a **Booking Management System**, the **Checkout** feature might have the following acceptance criteria:

- Users must be able to review their booking details (dates, room type, price) before payment.  
- The system must support at least two payment methods (e.g., credit card and PayPal).  
- Payment information must be securely encrypted and stored according to industry standards.  
- A confirmation message must be displayed immediately after successful payment.  
- The system must send a confirmation email with booking details within 5 minutes of checkout.  
- If payment fails, users must see an error message and be able to retry or select another payment method.
