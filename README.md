## Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?
A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of how users (actors) interact with a system to achieve specific goals. It captures functional requirements by illustrating the relationships between actors and use cases.

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**
- Provides a **clear overview** of system functionality.  
- Helps identify **interactions between users and the system**.  
- Facilitates communication between stakeholders and developers.  
- Acts as a **foundation for creating detailed requirements and test cases**.
