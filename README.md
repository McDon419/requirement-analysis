# Requirement Analysis

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a system or project. It forms the foundation of software development, ensuring that the final product addresses the right problems and delivers value.

During requirement analysis, developers and stakeholders collaborate to clarify what the system should do, how it should behave, and the constraints under which it must operate.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is critical because it directly impacts the success or failure of a project. A well-executed requirement analysis ensures that the final system aligns with stakeholder needs, avoids wasted effort, and minimizes costly mistakes later in development.

### Key Reasons Why It’s Important:
- **Prevents Miscommunication:** Clearly defines expectations so that everyone (stakeholders, developers, testers) shares the same understanding.  
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Identifies potential issues and risks early, reducing rework and unnecessary development efforts.  
- **Ensures Business Value:** Confirms that the solution solves the right problems and contributes to organizational goals.  
- **Improves Quality:** Provides precise criteria for design, development, and testing, leading to a more reliable system.  
- **Enhances User Satisfaction:** Ensures user needs and pain points are addressed, creating a product that people actually want to use.  
- **Supports Project Planning:** Helps in estimating timelines, resources, and scope more accurately.

In short, requirement analysis lays the groundwork for a successful software project by ensuring that the team builds **the right system, the right way, for the right users**.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement analysis is not a one-time task but a structured process involving several activities. Each activity ensures that requirements are well understood, clearly defined, and ready for implementation.

### Main Activities:
1. **Requirement Elicitation**
   - Gather needs from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, workshops, and observations.
   - Techniques: stakeholder interviews, user stories, workshops, shadowing, surveys.

2. **Requirement Documentation**
   - Record requirements in a clear and structured format (e.g., Software Requirements Specification - SRS, user stories, acceptance criteria).
   - Provide a single source of truth for team members.

3. **Requirement Analysis & Modeling**
   - Break down requirements into manageable pieces.
   - Model behavior using use case diagrams, flowcharts, data models, or prototypes.

4. **Requirement Validation**
   - Confirm with stakeholders that documented requirements match expectations (reviews, walkthroughs, prototypes).
   - Reduce misunderstanding and scope drift.

5. **Requirement Management**
   - Track changes over time and maintain traceability.
   - Prioritize, version, and handle scope changes to avoid uncontrolled growth.

## Types of Requirements

In requirement analysis, requirements are typically categorized so the team knows **what** to build, **how well** it must perform, and **why** it exists.

### 1. Functional Requirements
These specify **what the system should do**—the features and behaviors the software must support.
**Examples (Hotel Booking App):**
- Users should be able to **search** hotels by location, date, price
