## Types of Requirements  

In requirement analysis, requirements are typically categorized into different types. This classification helps teams understand not only *what the system must do* but also *how it should perform* and *why it exists in the first place*.  

### 1. **Functional Requirements**  
These specify **what the system should do** â€” the core functionalities, tasks, or behaviors the software must support.  
- Example in Hotel Booking App:  
  - Users should be able to **search for hotels** by location, date, and price.  
  - Hotel managers should be able to **add/update hotel details** like room type, price, and availability.  
  - The system should allow customers to **book and pay** for rooms securely.  

### 2. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

- Example in Hotel Booking App:  
  - The system should handle **high traffic** during peak booking seasons (scalability).  
  - Search results should load within **2 seconds** (performance).  
  - Payments must comply with **PCI DSS standards** (security).  
  - The app should be available **99.9% uptime** (reliability).  

### 3. **Business Requirements**  
These represent the **high-level goals and objectives** of the business or organization. They explain *why* the system is being developed.  
- Example in Hotel Booking App:  
  - Increase hotel booking conversion rates by **20%** over 12 months.  
  - Provide a **global marketplace** where hotels and customers interact.  
  - Enable hotel partners to **digitally manage their listings** and reduce dependency on offline travel agents.  

### 4. **User Requirements**  
These describe the **needs and expectations of the end-users** who interact with the system. They are often written in simple, non-technical language.
